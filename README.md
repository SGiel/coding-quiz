# Stephanie's Coding Quiz

## Description 

This web application generates a multiple-choice timed JavaScript coding quiz. It prompts user for their initals and when they hit start the timer starts counting down. They have 30 seconds to answer 5 multiple choice questions. If a question is answered incorrectly, then 10 seconds is deducted from the timer. The quiz is over when all the questions are answered or when the timer runs out of time. When the quiz is over, the user is told whether they have achieved a personal high score. If they have achieved a high score they are asked whether they would like to save this high score.

This JavaScript code contains skills I recently learned including accessing localStorage to save and retrieve date, using addEventListener and at the same time understanding where the actual listening was occurring (how events are delegated), using if/else statements and for loops, and writing into HTML elements with JavaScript.
